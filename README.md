RSSredditbot
============

A reddit bot which can be used to post/message rss feed content. 
Uses a PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), flask webserver, and RSSparser python modules

The script creates the flask web server and loops continuously, waiting for a period of time
to avoid spamming/overposting content

OAuth and username and password must be added, and coded to desired functionality

Another just for fun/learning project
